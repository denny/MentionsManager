	<h3>Why did @Denny / @DennysBlockBot just block me on Twitter?</h3>
	
	<div id="truncatedusername" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>Your username starts with my username.</i>
	</p>
	<p>	
		I'm guessing you didn't mean to post something to me at all, you just 
		meant to post a shortened version of your own username.  If you think 
		about it, you can probably see why that's not a good idea - once you 
		shorten it, it's a different username!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="atdennys" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>Your tweet just said "@Denny's"</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are four main problems with this:
		<ol>
			<li>
				'@' is a special symbol on Twitter, which should only 
				be used as the start of a username.  If you're using it 
				to mean 'at', you probably shouldn't be - in case you 
				end up sending messages to random strangers (hi!)
			</li>
			<li>
				Usernames can't have apostrophes in them. So you're 
				actually posting the username "@Denny" here, and not 
				"@Denny's".
			</li>
			<li>
				Denny's Diner don't own the username @Denny or @Dennys - 
				their username is 
				<a href="https://twitter.com/DennysDiner">@DennysDiner</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you start a tweet with a username, only that user and 
				their friends will see it in their feeds.  So, if you're 
				posting "@Denny's" to let your friends know where you are 
				right now, it probably won't work.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		So, for future reference - your tweet should have said either 
		"At @DennysDiner", or "At Denny's".
	</p>
	<p>
		PS: I hope you enjoyed your meal, but if you didn't, please don't 
		complain to me!  Remember, their username is 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/DennysDiner">@DennysDiner</a>  :)
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="dennysdiner" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You're talking about Denny's Diner, and you used the username 
		"@Denny's".</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are a few potential problems with this:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Denny's Diner don't own the username @Denny or @Dennys - 
				their username is 
				<a href="https://twitter.com/DennysDiner">@DennysDiner</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Usernames can't have apostrophes in them. So you're 
				actually talking to "@Denny" when you type "@Denny's"
			</li>
			<li>
				'@' is a special symbol on Twitter, which should only 
				be used as the start of a username.  If you're using it 
				to mean 'at', you probably shouldn't be.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		So, if you have a comment, compliment or complaint for/about 
		Denny's, try re-posting it using their correct username: 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/DennysDiner">@DennysDiner</a>
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="dennyhamlin" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You were talking about Denny Hamlin (and/or NASCAR), but you 
		used my username (@Denny) instead of his username 
		(<a href="https://twitter.com/dennyhamlin">@DennyHamlin</a>)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember, there are no spaces in usernames on Twitter!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="dennycagur" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You were talking about Denny Cagur, but you used 
		my username (@Denny) instead of his username 
		(<a href="https://twitter.com/dennycagur">@DennyCagur</a>)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember, there are no spaces in usernames on Twitter!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="dennygitong" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You were talking about Denny Gitong, but you used 
		my username (@Denny) instead of his username 
		(<a href="https://twitter.com/dennygitong">@DennyGitong</a>)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember, there are no spaces in usernames on Twitter!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="dennysumargo" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You were talking about Denny Sumargo, but you used 
		my username (@Denny) instead of his username 
		(<a href="https://twitter.com/sumargodenny">@SumargoDenny</a>)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		His username doesn't even start with 'denny' - please try to get it 
		right!
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="indonesia" class="hide">
	<p>
		<i>You're in Indonesia.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know anybody in Indonesia, but it seems that Denny is a very 
		common first name there.  You probably meant to send a message to one 
		of your friends whose username starts with '@denny', but you didn't 
		use their whole username, so instead you sent a message to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember, there are no spaces in usernames on Twitter.  Also, don't 
		deliberately cut a username short - it changes whose username it is!
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		<i>So many people make this kind of mistake, that I wrote 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/DennysBlockBot">@DennysBlockBot</a> 
		to block them automatically - so that I can see the messages 
		that are actually meant for me on my mentions page, without 
		having to scroll past dozens of messages not meant for me!</i>
